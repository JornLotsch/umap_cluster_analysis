# umap_cluster_analysis
## Why umap_cluster_analysis?
Laboratory errors in lipidomics can produce biologically plausible but incorrect results. Our package integrates dimensionality reduction with cluster analysis to detect these errors through an intuitive visual framework, enabling researchers to identify problematic samples before they impact downstream analyses.
## Ideal for:
- Lipidomic quality control pipelines
- Multi-omics data validation
- Sample classification verification
- Biomarker discovery studies
- Clinical research quality assurance

## Technical Highlights
âœ… **Comprehensive Analysis** - From raw data to final visualizations in a single function ðŸ“ˆ **Detailed Outputs** - Includes coordinates, clusters, visualizations, and misclassified samples list ðŸ§® **Statistical Rigor** - Based on established dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms ðŸ“Š **Publication-Ready Graphics** - Generates high-quality SVG/PNG outputs for direct use in publications
